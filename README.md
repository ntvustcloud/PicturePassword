Picture-Based Authentication Systems: A Solution against Shoulder-Surfing Attacks

What is the problem that the tool aims to solve?
There are many benefits to picture-based authentication, but the use of picture-based authentication is being halted by shoulder-surfing attacks. Shoulder-surfing attacks are when observers see from a distance a user inputting their password.

Severity of the Issue?
Individual Level - Obtaining PIN numbers from ATMs when customers incorrectly believe that their session was over.

Organizational Level -Insider threats could include access key information in an organization, resulting in losing sensitive data, destruction, etc.

How Do we Solve the Problem? Goal?
Goal — Build an application that overcomes Shoulder-Surfing Attacks.
A way that allows users to confidently input their password, even if an observer were to be watching the entire time...
To solve the problem, build an application that introduces false inputs to disguise the real password.

How it work?
user setup some specific position on a picture as a password
When the user logs in, it requires the user to click on the spot of password, and some random spot is not a password; together, it will always be a different password every time the user logs in. 
Therefore, when a user is suffering an attack, the hacker does not know which one is the final password.
